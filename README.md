earth rotates on its axis and is at the center of the scene, taking almost the whole screen. the moon rotates around the earth and its own axis, meanwhile a bat also rotates around the earth in a random way. some controls are at the disposal of the user, allowing him to burn the earth, rise the temperature, start wars, spread viruses, and so on ...
